== Selected Text

What treatment should a selection in the document recieve when pasting an 
image with the plugin?

.Could contribute as the filename footnote:[this is how the plugin currently handles selected text.]
sunset -> `image::sunset.png[]`

.Could contribute as the directory footnote:[this overrides the `:imagesdir:`` behaviour, which I don't like]
sunsets/ -> `image::sunsets/image.png[]`

.Could contribute as _both_ filename and directory footnote:[this would only work on relative paths, and again contradicts the `:imagesdir:` behaviour]
sunsets/sunset -> `image::sunsets/sunset.png[]` 

.Could contribute the alt-text of the image footnote:[this would be useful, but I don't see a clean way to implement it without breaking using selections as filenames]
'A picture of a sunset over the local beach'- 1986, Victoria +
-> image::image.png['A picture of a sunset over the local beach'- 1986, Victoria]

Could setup each of these as its own command and just let the user map to them as required.
